                    Face the fool
                    December's tragic drive
                    When time is poetry
                    And stolen the world outside
                    The waiting could crush my heart
                    
                    Sew it on
                    Face the fool
                    The tide breaks, a wave of fear
                    And brave songs disappear
                    To the secret voice of dawn
                    This last time raise my eyes
                    
                    You'll taste it, you'll taste it
                    In time

                    In time
                    The right words
                    In time
                    The right words in time
                    
                    Sew it on
                    Face the fool
                    The mirrors lie, those aren't my eyes
                    Destroy them, raise my hand
                    Reflected in savage shards
                    A new face, a soul reborn
                    
                    You'll taste it, you'll taste it
                    In time
                    You'll taste it, you'll taste it
                    In time
